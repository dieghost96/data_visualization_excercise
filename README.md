# Simple Data Visualization with Python

This project demonstrates how to create a simple bar chart using Python and the Matplotlib library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
- Matplotlib library. Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Import Libraries**:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```

2. **Prepare Data**:
   ```python
   categories = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
   values = [10, 24, 36, 48, 52]
   ```

3. **Create Bar Chart**:
   ```python
   plt.bar(categories, values)
   plt.xlabel('Categories')
   plt.ylabel('Values')
   plt.title('Simple Bar Chart')
   plt.show()
   ```

4. **Run the Code**:
   - Save your file (e.g., `bar_chart.py`) and run it:
     ```bash
     python bar_chart.py
     ```
